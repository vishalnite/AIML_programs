    "\n",
    "The code demonstrates a genetic algorithm to evolve a population of strings towards a target string. The genetic algorithm initializes a population of random strings, evaluates their fitness based on how closely they match the target string \"Machine Learning,\" and iteratively evolves the population through selection, crossover, and mutation operations. Each individual in the population represents a candidate solution (string), and their fitness is determined by the number of characters that differ from the target string. The algorithm applies elitism by selecting the top 10% of individuals with the lowest fitness scores to pass unchanged to the next generation. The remaining 90% of the population is generated through crossover of pairs of individuals and occasional mutation. The process continues until an individual with a perfect fitness score (matching the target string) is found or a maximum number of generations is reached. The algorithm prints the progress of the best individual in each generation, including the string, its fitness score, and the generation number."
